# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Personal Info
### General
I'm Bruno GiÃ£o, I'm 18, and I'm currently studying (1st Year) Computer Science at UMinho!
### Hobbies
So, I guess you could say I like coding (yeah kinda corny), anything relating to music and memes I guess. I also very much enjoy playing video games, in fact, you could say that, besides music, video games might just be my greatest passion!
## Work
... WIP (?)
